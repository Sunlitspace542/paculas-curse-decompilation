# Pac-Guy 2: Part 3: Kansylvania (Pacula's Curse) Decompilation
A decompilation of Pac-Guy 2: Part 3: Kansylvania brought to you by CTFAK and one clever folk.

## Changes
- Game now runs in windowed mode instead of full screen  
- Lives counter displays weird

## Bugs
- Issues with incorrect transitions and transparency stuff

## Credits
- Astral Entertainment for making the original game  
- Jerry Belich (for recompiling the game in Fusion 2.5 in 2017, which made this decomp possible)
- Plaindinks for saving a copy of the recompiled EXE
- CTFAK Team  

## File information

The 106MB .MFA project file was split into 8 .7z format volumes. (too big for GitHub)

There are also 3 MP3 files used for background music in the game that are required. These are included.

The Ovine Rubber Transitions DLL is also needed. (Included)

MFA was generated from ``Pacula-2017-Fusion-A.exe``, SHA1: ``45900af49fea3c495ffe0043538755f2f246772e``
